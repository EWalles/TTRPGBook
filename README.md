# ttrpgbook

This code was written to start building a website similar to facebook or meetup to find ttrpg (table top roleplay games) groups.
It is very rough at the moment and I plan on expanding it more as I get more experience.

<ul>
<li>Home
<li>Games
</ul>
## Getting Started

<h1>Next Steps in the future</h1>
<ul>
<li> Add users and the ability to log in about games.
<li> add a chat function for users to talk to other users
<li> add a 'include your discord' link
<li> add in splash pages for the games (reviews, blurbs)
</ul>
